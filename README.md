### 🩺 ICU Stay Prediction and Patient Insights Dashboard with R Shiny

- **Timeline:** 01/2025 – 03/2025  
- **Summary:**  
Designed and implemented a complete machine learning workflow to identify extended ICU stays (>2 days), leveraging logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and ensemble stacking methods. Performed exploratory analyses on large-scale MIMIC-IV data comprising over 65,000 ICU admissions and 200,000 emergency department encounters. Developed an interactive R Shiny application to support flexible exploration of patient-level information, including demographics, clinical events, vital signs, and admission–discharge–transfer (ADT) timelines. Addressed data incompleteness through imputation strategies to enhance model stability and performance.
- **Tech Stack:**  
  R (Shiny, ggplot2, caret, glmnet), BigQuery, Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Model Stacking)
